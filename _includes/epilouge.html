<p>Platform engineering is an exciting new paradigm in the field of DevOps, and the platform teams that implement this
    discipline have a unique opportunity to effectively run a startup in their own company as they create an IDP as an
    internal product.</p>

<p>To be successful, platform teams must adopt a product mindset, which involves:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Articulate your IDP's value to high-level stakeholders, who are ultimately responsible for investing in your
        ideas.
    </li>
    <li>Gathering and inspiring ideas for how your IDP will support DevOps teams to achieve their goals while removing
        pain points from existing processes.
    </li>
    <li>Establishing the support, feedback, and internal marketing processes to keep your customers happy and
        informed.
    </li>
    <li>Building feedback loops to ensure your priorities align with your customers.</li>
    <li>Clearly articulating the responsibilities of the platform team and your customers to update and maintain the
        artifacts generated by your IDP.
    </li>
    <li>Understanding the pillars of a holistic DevOps lifecycle and sharing those insights with your customers.</li>
</ul>

<p>By following the processes outlined in this book, organizations looking to establish a platform team benefit from a
    set of activities and practical checklists that ensure the product you build improves DevEx and the performance of
    your DevOps teams for many years to come.</p>

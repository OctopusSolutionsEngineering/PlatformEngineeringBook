    We ask a lot of DevOps teams. These teams are engines of innovation using some of the most complex tools ever
    created while building harmonious and efficient environments able to assume responsibility for any new
    requirements.
</p>

<p>Every DevOps team strives to be high performing. But as James Clear noted in his book "Atomic Habits":</p>

<blockquote><p>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.</p></blockquote>

<p>
    DEaaS is an approach to building systems, or architectural decisions, that can be implemented at scale throughout
    DevOps teams using the practices of platform engineering with the explicit purpose of improving DevEx. By adopting
    DevEx as the goal of platform engineering, DEaaS provides a clear and measurable outcome that acts as the foundation
    for high performing DevOps teams.
</p>

<p>
    Or, in other words, DEaaS provides systems that high performing DevOps teams can fall back to.
</p>

<p>This book covered the activities required for DevOps teams looking to establish DEaaS, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Articulating your IDP's value to high-level stakeholders, who are ultimately responsible for investing in your
        ideas
    </li>
    <li>Gathering and inspiring ideas for how your IDP will support DevOps teams to achieve their goals while removing
        pain points from existing processes
    </li>
    <li>Establishing the support, feedback, and internal marketing processes to keep your customers happy and
        informed
    </li>
    <li>Building feedback loops to ensure your priorities align with your customers</li>
    <li>Clearly articulating the responsibilities of the platform team and your customers to update and maintain the
        artifacts generated by your IDP
    </li>
    <li>Understanding the pillars of a holistic DevOps lifecycle and sharing those insights with your customers</li>
</ul>

<p>By following the processes outlined in this book, organizations looking to establish a platform team benefit from a
    set of activities and practical checklists that ensure the product you build improves DevEx and the performance of
    your DevOps teams for many years to come.</p>

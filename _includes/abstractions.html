<h1><a id="abstractions">The "abstractions with infinite flexibility" fallacy</a></h1>

<p>Those looking to introduce platform engineering into existing DevOps teams face three common realities:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your IDP is a greenfield project</li>
    <li>Your platform team must reduce the mental burden of an existing, complex environment</li>
    <li>Your customers are technically adept</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The purpose of an IDP is to generate opinionated artifacts embedding the accumulated business knowledge and best
    practices learned by your customers over the years. By design, these artifacts abstract away much of the tribal
    knowledge required to build high quality solutions, allowing DevOps team to focus on solving novel problems rather
    than duplicating the effort required to solve already solved problems.
</p>

<p>
    The challenge when developing such abstractions is to strike the right balance between hiding complexity and
    enabling flexibility.
</p>

<p>
    Platform teams have the added challenge of being compared to the established platforms their IDP seeks to
    abstract away. The reality is that these existing platforms were adopted because of the many years, countless hours,
    and eye-watering sums of money that were spent refining the balance between complexity and flexibility. For example,
    popular operating systems, hypervisors, cloud platforms, and container orchestration platforms all have billions
    of dollars worth of development behind them.
</p>

<p>
    Meanwhile, enough of your customers will be comfortable with these underlying platforms, meaning they will quickly
    spot, and likely be frustrated by, the limitations of your abstractions. This risks making your IDP the kind of
    blocker that it was supposed to remove.
</p>

<p>
    It is not a question of whether abstractions are valuable or possible to build correctly, as every successful piece
    of
    technology is an example of building a useful abstraction: a car abstracts the complexity of an engine and
    transmission behind a steering wheel, accelerator, and brake; an electrical powerpoint abstracts the continent sized
    infrastructure of a power grid; and a phone abstracts a worldwide communication network. The better question,
    especially for new platform teams, is whether you have the knowledge to create the correct level of abstraction
    first time, or the time to refine these abstractions as you acquire more knowledge?
</p>

<p>
    The only safe initial answer to this question is "No", with an aim to reach the point where the answer is "Yes, but...".
    You will never have perfect knowledge of your customer's needs, but a successful platform team can refine their
    abstractions over time. But you do need to have some level of early success to earn the time required to refine
    your solutions.
</p>

<p>
    Anyone aiming to provide an opinionated solution faces this same dilemma, but the survivorship bias of every
    successful abstraction you see in daily life can make it seem like building abstractions is easy. However, new
    platform teams must assume building abstractions is, in fact, quite difficult, and therefor have a plan to support
    customers with unique needs or opinions of their own. This is the crux of the responsibility levels presented in
    the chapter "Platform Engineering Responsibility Models":
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Centralized responsibility artifacts provide highly opinionated solutions exposing a relatively small number of
        options to customize the end result. These artifacts favor enforcing opinions over allowing flexibility. The
        success of the centralized responsibility model is highly dependent on how closely aligned your abstractions are
        to the needs of your customers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Shared responsibility artifacts can be modified by customers, providing them with the ability to customize their
        solution while still allowing the platform team to centrally distribute updates. These artifacts are the most
        flexible and provide a sliding scale between enforcing opinions and exposing flexibility (with the caveat that increased
        customization will typically decrease the ability to centrally distribute updates). The shared responsibility
        model assumes abstractions will be imperfect and emphasises a workflow that allows platform teams and their
        customers to jointly refine the solution over time.
    </li>
    <li>
        Customer responsibility artifacts provide customers with a base template that they are expected to own and
        modify to suit their needs. While the templates can provide an initial set of opinions, they are
        expected to be heavily modified. The customer responsibility model assumes customers will keep what is useful
        and discard what is not.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    An anti-pattern to avoid when starting a new platform team is focusing to heavily on the centralized responsibility model. This
    model requires that you build the most accurate abstractions, and starting a new platform team is the time when you
    have the least amount of information.
</p>

<p>
    The shared responsibility model requires platform teams to build workflows that facilitate shared development of
    artifacts. While tools like Git provide a great foundation for these workflows, platform teams must still invest
    time in ensuring artifacts can be tracked and merged over time. The benefit of this model is that it provides a
    direct feedback loop between the platform team and your customers and accepts that the abstractions underpinning
    your IDPs artifacts will need to evolve over time.

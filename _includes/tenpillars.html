<h1><a id="tenpillars">The 10 pillars of pragmatic deployments</a></h1>

<p>The shift-left mentality is a valuable guide when determining which steps in the DevOps lifecycle to codify and scale
    with your IDP. Identifying problems late in the lifecycle and implementing common strategies to resolve them earlier
    reduces cost and increases velocity. Or, following the motto of Extreme Programming:</p>

<p class="quote">If it hurts, do it more often.</p>

<p>Exact numbers around the value of finding bugs earlier are hard to come by. The post “Everyone cites that 'bugs are
    100x more expensive to fix in production' research, but the study might not even exist” (<a
            href="https://oc.to/rLmuBw">https://oc.to/rLmuBw</a>)
    references research from Hillel Wayne that questions the validity of this commonly cited metric. However, the byline
    of that article concedes, "It's probably still true, though, says formal methods expert."</p>

<p>While it doesn’t provide meme-worthy quotes, the report “The Economic Impacts of Inadequate Infrastructure for
    Software Testing” (<a href="https://oc.to/Tq1Zlh">https://oc.to/Tq1Zlh</a>), prepared for the National Institute of
    Standards and Technology (NIST),
    performed a case study in the financial services sector to estimate the economic impact of inadequate infrastructure
    for software testing, finding:</p>

<p class="quote">The major benefits developers cited from an improved infrastructure were direct cost reduction in the
    development
    process and a decrease in post-purchase customer support. An additional benefit that respondents thought would
    emerge from an improved testing infrastructure is increased confidence in the quality of the product they produce
    and ship.</p>

<p>Identifying issues early in the DevOps lifecycle means identifying them while planning new features, writing and
    testing code, or as part of your Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. The rest of the DevOps
    lifecycle takes place after you deploy code to production. These are are the lifecycle stages that issue identification
    and rectification are ideally moved out of.</p>

<p>Your CI/CD pipeline is a desirable target for your IDP because this process should be mostly automated, so
    DevOps teams can apply improvements at scale. But, more importantly, your existing CI and CD platforms have likely
    already solved many of the requirements that enable automation:</p>

<ul>
    <li>They provide an execution environment (in the form of agents or workers) to run automated scripts and
        applications
    </li>
    <li>They have an established process for maintaining authentication and authorization</li>
    <li>They have existing access to your critical infrastructure</li>
    <li>Existing operations teams support them</li>
    <li>Their pipelines are easily modified to include new steps, or triggers provide hooks into existing workflows
    </li>
    <li>DevOps teams are already familiar with them</li>
</ul>

<p>The chapter "Planning your Internal Developer Platform" recommends clearly defining your IDP's mission. This ensures the focus of the platform team is on a specific, achievable outcome. This mission statement has 2 parts:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Non-functional requirements providing a high-level description of the outcome</li>
     <li>Functional requirements that describe how the feature works</li>
</ul>


<p>While functional requirements align with DevOps teams' specific processes and goals, non-functional requirements
    represent common high-level scenarios applicable to a wide variety of teams.
</p>

<p>This chapter describes 10 non-functional requirements, or pillars, related to CI/CD pipelines. These pillars
    represent desirable traits to prompt discussions with customers or standardize across your customer base.
</p>

<h2>Pillar 1. Repeatable deployments</h2>

<p>Software teams are deploying software to production more frequently than ever. They also make deployments to
    pre-production environments as part of their deployment pipeline.</p>

<p>To be confident when you change software at high velocity, you need a mix of methods to confirm the release-ability of your software. These methods include test automation, exploratory testing, self-beta testing (drinking your own champagne), and other techniques.</p>

<p>These techniques are only helpful if what you deploy to production is the same as what you deploy to your other
    environments.</p>

<p>The pillar of repeatable deployments requires you to deploy the same thing in the same way each time you deploy an
    application version.</p>

<h3>General deployment concepts</h3>

<p>To understand repeatable deployments, we need to fine-tune our definitions. We must be precise with some terms
    relating to deployment pipelines and the timing of different stages.</p>

<h4>Deployment pipelines</h4>

<p>A deployment pipeline starts when you commit code to a source code repository. And it follows the change all the way to the production environment.</p>

<p>Every activity to progress the change is part of your deployment pipeline. Whether manual or automated, this includes:</p>
    
<ul>
    <li>Code reviews</li>
    <li>Builds</li>
    <li>Testing</li>
    <li>Release management</li>
    <li>Sign-offs</li>
    <li>Deployments</li>
</ul>

<h4>Continuous Integration</h4>

<p>The most common entry point to a deployment pipeline is Continuous Integration (CI). This is the process of
    committing code, compiling it, running tests, packaging a new application version, and publishing it.</p>

<p>Dave Farley and Jez Humble recommend changes are regularly integrated into the main branch in source control (hence
    the "continuous" in "Continuous Integration"). Many teams use the term more loosely to define their automated build
    process.</p>

<h4>Continuous Delivery</h4>

<p>While Continuous Integration is the automation of creating a deployable package each time the code changes,
    Continuous Delivery (CD) extends this through to deployment automation and monitoring.</p>

<p>You might still have some manual stages in your deployment pipeline, such as exploratory testing or an approval
    process. But you should automate all deployment steps as this helps you achieve repeatable deployments.</p>

<p>Using the same deployment process for all environments means it gets tested as often as the application.</p>

<h4>Continuous Deployment</h4>

<p>Continuous Deployment takes CI/CD a step further. It removes all manual intervention to create a fully automated commit-to-consumer workflow. The deployment pipeline automatically rejects a bad application version and deploys all good versions to production without manual approvals.</p>

<h4>CI/CD</h4>
<p>CI/CD refers to the combination of Continuous Integration with Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment.</p>

<p>Teams commonly deploy to the development environment without manual intervention but let people control when they deploy to subsequent environments. We've learned from most of our customers that this approach <i>works well for them.</i></p>

<p>In the test environment, quality assurance (QA) staff validate changes, product owners review new functionality, security teams probe for vulnerabilities, etc. When everyone is happy that the changes meet their requirements, they can promote the application version to production.</p>

<p>The production environment is the final destination. It's where end users can use the application.</p>

<h3>What is an environment?</h3>

<p>Environments represent the boundaries between copies of individual applications or entire application stacks and
    their supporting infrastructure.</p>

<p>Each environment should reasonably reflect the production environment. This ensures the application will behave
    consistently and avoids surprises when you go live.</p>

<p>You might frequently deploy to earlier environments, trading stability for faster feedback. Your users expect
    production environments to be stable.</p>

<p>You progress deployments through environments to increase confidence that you can deliver a working solution to the
    end user.</p>

<p>We call the canonical set of environments development, test, and production. The table below describes the
    characteristics of these environments:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Environment</td>
        <td>Description</td>
        <td>Deployment Frequency</td>
        <td>Stability / Confidence</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Development</td>
        <td>Used by developers to test individual changes as they're implemented.</td>
        <td>High</td>
        <td>Low</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Test</td>
        <td>Used by developers, QA, and non-technical staff to validate that changes meet requirements.</td>
        <td>Medium</td>
        <td>Medium</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Production</td>
        <td>Accessed by end users to consume the publicly available instance of the applications.</td>
        <td>Low</td>
        <td>High</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Although you can have any number of environments with different names, we use this set of environments in this
    book.</p>

<h3>What is a deployment?</h3>

<p>We talked about deploying "applications" to environments, but to appreciate how you achieve repeatable
    deployments, we must be more specific about what we deploy.</p>

<p>A deployment should include a snapshot of:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The application version</li>
    <li>The deployment process</li>
    <li>The variables used to configure the application for an environment</li>
    <li>Inline scripts that support the deployment and configuration of the application and infrastructure</li>
</ol>

<p>Octopus combines these into a <i>release</i>, which captures the current deployment state. The release snapshot ensures you use the same snapshot for the release, even if you change the process, variables, or scripts during environment progression.</p>

<p>Without a release snapshot, you could deploy a tested application version using an untested deployment process,
    resulting in a problem in your production environment.</p>

<h2>Pillar 2. Verifiable deployments</h2>

<p>The repeatable deployments pillar describes how promoting releases through environments increases confidence in the
    application version and deployment process.</p>

<p>The pillar of verifiable deployments describes the techniques you can use to verify a deployment when it
    reaches a new environment.</p>

<h3>General testing concepts</h3>

<p>Testing is a nebulous term with often ill-defined subcategories. We won't attempt to provide authoritative definitions of testing categories here. We aim to offer a high-level description of common testing practices and highlight those you can use when you deploy.</p>

<h4>What don't we test during deployments?</h4>

<p>We consider unit tests part of the build pipeline. They're closely tied to the code and must pass for the build
    server to publish the application package.</p>

<p>You might also run integration tests during the build process to verify components interact as expected. Sometimes,
    you might use a test double instead of a real component to improve reliability. Otherwise, you might spin up the
    dependencies as part of the test.</p>

<p>The tests run by the build server should result in you publishing a high-quality application package. Bad application versions should get prevented from progressing.</p>

<h4>What can we test during deployment?</h4>

<p>Tests that need a live application or application stack to be accessible are ideal candidates to run as part of a deployment process.</p>

<p>Smoke tests are quick tests designed to ensure you deploy applications and services correctly. Smoke tests implement
    the minimum interaction to ensure services respond correctly. Some examples include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>An HTTP request of a web application or service to check for a successful response.</li>
    <li>A database login to ensure the database is available.</li>
    <li>Checking that a directory has been populated with files.</li>
    <li>Querying the infrastructure layer to ensure the expected resources were created.</li>
</ul>

<p>Integration tests can run as part of your build or deployment processes. Integration tests validate that multiple
    components are interacting as you expect. You may include test doubles with the deployment to stand in for
    dependencies, or the tests may verify 2 or more running component instances.</p>

<p>Examples include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Signing into a web application to verify that it can interact with an authentication provider.</li>
    <li>Querying an API for results from a database to ensure that the database is accessible via a service.</li>
</ul>

<p>End-to-end tests provide an automated way of interacting with a system like a user would. These can be
    long-running
    tests following paths through the application that require most or all application stack components to work
    correctly. Examples include:</p>
    
<ul>
    <li>
        Automating the interaction with an online store to browse a catalog, view an item, add it to a cart, complete
        the checkout, and review the account order history.
    </li>
    <li>
        Completing a series of API calls to a weather service to find a city's latitude and longitude, getting the
        current weather for the returned location, and returning the forecast for the rest of the week.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Chaos testing involves deliberately removing or interfering with the components that make up an application. This validates that the system is resilient enough to withstand such failures. You can combine chaos testing with other tests to verify the stability of a degraded system.</p>

<p>Usability and acceptance testing often involve a human using the application to verify that it meets the requirements. The requirements can be subjective, for example, determining if the application is visually appealing. Or the testers may be non-technical and don't have the option of automating tests. The manual and subjective nature of these tests makes them difficult, if not impossible, to automate. This means you must deploy a working copy of the application or application stack and make it accessible to testers.</p>

<h2>Pillar 3. Seamless deployments</h2>

<p>When you deploy your application, you need to switch users from the old application version to the new one. The
    pillar of seamless deployments discusses approaches to reducing the user impact when you update the application.</p>

<p>One of the easiest ways to deploy an application without impacting users is to use planned maintenance windows. You
    can schedule these to occur outside of the users' regular working hours to minimize disruption to their work.</p>

<p>This approach is less practical if you have users in many time zones, need to minimize downtime, or want to deploy
    more often.</p>

<p>In these cases, you can use some common deployment strategies to deploy new application versions seamlessly.</p>

<h3>Seamless database deployments</h3>

<p>No discussion on seamless deployments can begin without first addressing the issue of database updates.</p>

<p>A fundamental aspect of most seamless deployment strategies involves running 2 versions of your application side-by-side, if only for a short time. If 2 versions of the application access the same database, all updates to the
    database schema and data must be compatible with both versions. We refer to this as backward and forward
    compatibility.</p>

<p>However, backward and forward compatibility is not trivial to implement. In the presentation Update your Database
    Schema with Zero Downtime Migrations (<a href="https://oc.to/BzKUy3">https://oc.to/BzKUy3</a>), based on chapter 3
    of the book Migrating to
    Microservice Databases (<a href="https://oc.to/nLvrV4">https://oc.to/nLvrV4</a>), Edison Yanaga walks through the
    process of renaming a single column
    in a database. It involves 6 incremental updates to the database and application code, and you must deploy each in
    sequence.</p>

<p>Seamless deployments involving a database require:</p>

<ul>
<li>Careful planning</li>
<li>Many small steps to roll out the changes</li>
<li>Tight coordination between the database and application code</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more database techniques in Refactoring Databases (<a
        href="https://oc.to/huM7G3">https://oc.to/huM7G3</a>) by Scott W. Ambler and Pramod
    Saalage.</p>

<h3>Deployment strategies</h3>

<p>There are several ways to manage a cutover between an existing and a new application version. The right deployment
    strategy can help you achieve seamless deployments.</p>

<h4>Recreate</h4>

<p>The recreate strategy doesn't provide a seamless deployment. It's included here as the default option for most
    deployment processes. This strategy involves either:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Removing the existing deployment before deploying the new version</li>
    <li>Deploying the new version over the top of the current one</li>
</ul>

<p>Both options result in downtime between the existing version being stopped or removed and the new version starting.
    However, because you don't run the current and new versions concurrently, your database upgrade won't need to
    satisfy backward and forward compatibility requirements.</p>

<h4>Rolling updates</h4>

<p>The rolling update strategy involves incrementally updating instances of the current deployment with the new
    deployment. This strategy ensures at least one application instance is always available during the rollout.</p>

<p>Your load balancer will send users to instances with its usual balancing pattern. As the rollout progresses, more users will move onto the new application version. You can also take each instance out of balance before you update it, so requests aren't dropped during the deployment.</p>

<p>With rolling updates, your database will need to maintain backward and forward compatibility, as during the rollout
    it will receive connections from both the old and new application versions.</p>

<h4>Canary deployments</h4>

<p>The canary deployment strategy is similar to the rolling update strategy. Both incrementally expose more end users to the new deployment over time.</p>

<p>With canary deployments, you create a small group of users who get new versions before everyone else. This group may
    contain users who opt-in to get early access, represent a segment of your business (such as free-tier users), or be
    an algorithmic sample.</p>

<p>The first step of a canary deployment is to update the application instance used by your canary users. After you have
    collected information from this group, you can decide whether to continue the rollout. This may be a human decision,
    or you might automate it based on monitoring data or log files.</p>

<p>Canary deployments let you halt the rollout and revert to the previous application version if you find a problem
    in the sample group.</p>

<h4>Blue/green deployments</h4>
<p>The blue/green strategy involves deploying the new version (the green version) alongside the current version (the blue version) without exposing the green version to any traffic. After you deploy and verify the green version, traffic is cutover from the blue to the green version. When the green version handles all traffic, you can remove the blue version.</p>

<p>Any database changes deployed by the green version must maintain backward and forward compatibility. Even when the
    green version is not serving traffic, the blue version gets exposed to database changes.</p>

<p>This deployment strategy requires additional infrastructure during the deployment process. But you can create and destroy this infrastructure automatically, or use it as a cold standby, depending on your needs and cost constraints.</p>

<h4>Session-draining</h4>

<p>You can use the session-draining strategy when applications maintain states tied to a particular application
    version.</p>

<p>This strategy is similar to the blue/green strategy as it also means you deploy the new version alongside the current
    version, running both side-by-side. Unlike the blue/green strategy, session-draining will direct only new sessions
    to the new version while the existing one continues to serve traffic for existing sessions.</p>

<p>You need the same infrastructure and clean-up for blue/green and session-draining strategies.</p>

<p>Any database changes must maintain backward and forward compatibility because the old and new application versions
    run side-by-side.</p>

<h4>Feature flags</h4>

<p>The feature flag strategy involves building functionality into a new application version and using a toggle or
    feature flag to control its visibility. This lets you control feature visibility without needing a deployment.</p>

<p>In practice, you deploy a new application version with flaggable features with one of the strategies above, so the feature flag strategy complements those other strategies.</p>

<h4>Feature branch</h4>

<p>The feature branch strategy lets developers deploy an application version with changes they're working on. It's usually deployed in a non-production environment alongside the main deployment.</p>

<p>Maintaining database backward and forward compatibility may not be necessary with feature branch deployments. Because
    feature branches are short-lived for testing, it's acceptable that each deployment has access to an isolated test
    database.</p>

<h2>Pillar 4. Recoverable deployments</h2>
<p>Despite your best efforts with repeatable and verifiable deployments, you'll always need to handle production bugs.
    When this happens, quickly and safely recovering is crucial.</p>

<h3>Rolling Back or Forward</h3>
<p>Recovering from an undesirable deployment means choosing whether to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Roll back to a previous good application version</li>
<li>Roll forward to a new version that returns the environment to a desirable state</li>
</ul>

<p>Either solution works with stateless applications, but you must treat rollbacks with care when there's a database
    involved.</p>

<p>This is the advice from the FlyWay project (<a href="https://oc.to/lVr2Zn">https://oc.to/lVr2Zn</a>):</p>

<p class="quote">While the idea of undo migrations is nice, unfortunately it sometimes breaks down in practice. As soon
    as you have
    destructive changes (drop, delete, truncate, …), you start getting into trouble. And even if you don't, you end up
    creating home-made alternatives for restoring backups, which need to be properly tested as well.</p>

<p>RedGate offers this advice for database rollbacks (<a href="https://oc.to/sbc7WW">https://oc.to/sbc7WW</a>):</p>

<p class="quote">Rather than investing time and energy into rollback planning, an alternative is to follow an approach
    that keeps you moving forward.</p>

<p>The blog post “Pitfalls with SQL rollbacks and automated database deployments” (<a href="https://oc.to/WRvLE4">https://oc.to/WRvLE4</a>)
    has this
    advice:</p>
<p class="quote">
    More often than not, the effort to successfully rollback a deployment far exceeds the effort it would take to push a
    fix to production.</p>

<p>When deployments involve database changes, we recommend rolling forward to recover from an undesirable deployment.</p>

<h3>Rolling back</h3>

<p>If you achieved the pillar of <i>repeatable deployments</i>, you can roll back by re-running a previous deployment. This is possible because the package versions, scripts, and variables are all captured by a repeatable deployment.</p>

<p>Rollbacks are also an explicit feature of several seamless deployment strategies:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Canary deployments implement rollbacks by redirecting all traffic from the new deployment to the current
        deployment.
    </li>
    <li>Blue/green deployments can roll back a deployment by cutting traffic back to the blue stack.</li>
    <li>Session-draining deployments can redirect new sessions to the current deployment and optionally kill any
        sessions in the new deployment.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Rollbacks have the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You can fix a deployment issue, without writing code, by rolling back to a previous deployment.</li>
    <li>A rollback leaves the system in a known, verified state.</li>
    <li>You can measure the time to complete a rollback in non-production environments.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rollbacks have the following disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Rollbacks are all-or-nothing operations. You can't roll back individual features, only entire
        deployments.
    </li>
    <li>You need to test rollbacks as part of the deployment process to ensure they work as expected. This increases
        the
        complexity and time of the deployment process.
    </li>
    <li>If a rollback fails, it's likely you'll need to resolve the issue by rolling forward.</li>
    <li>Database rollbacks require special consideration to ensure data is not lost.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rolling forward</h3>

<p>Rolling forward is another way to describe performing a new deployment. In this case, the new deployment will only
    contain the fixes required to restore an environment.</p>

<p>Rolling forward has the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
    <li>All deployment strategies, with or without a database, inherently support rolling forward.</li>
    <li>Teams gain experience in rolling forward with every deployment.</li>
    <li>You can choose the scope of a change or fix when rolling forward.</li>
    <li>You can deploy multiple times in succession while rolling forward to resolve an undesirable deployment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rolling forward has the following disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Rolling forward typically requires a developer to implement a fix to include in the next deployment.</li>
    <li>You must have a short lead time for changes. Otherwise, it's tempting to skip environments to expedite the fix.</li>
    <li>The production environment will be left in an undesirable state for as long as it takes to develop and deploy
        the next version.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Pillar 5. Visible deployments</h2>

<p>It can be challenging to track which application version you deployed to each environment. You shouldn't have to review the files on the disk or the structure and data in the database. This is like trying to work out what mix of colors produced a tin of paint.</p>

<p>Having a view of environments and application versions is crucial to understanding:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What features you provided to your customers</li>
    <li>What features are being tested</li>
    <li>What issues you fixed</li>
    <li>The history of any changes</li>
</ul>

<p>Listed below are the details required to gain complete visibility into the state of your deployments.</p>

<h3>Commit messages</h3>

<p>Commit messages capture the intention of source code edits, describing the changes made and who made them. These
    messages are invaluable when trying to understand at a low level what changes made it into a particular version of a
    package.</p>

<h3>Issue tracking</h3>

<p>Often, you make source code commits to resolve an issue documented in a dedicated issue tracker. These issues provide a space for you to describe, discuss, and track bugs. A unique identifier references each issue.</p>

<p>Capturing the issue IDs related to changes in a package version and any deployment that includes that package version
    provides insight into the issues resolved in any deployment.</p>

<h3>Build logs</h3>

<p>A typical CI/CD pipeline will have a build server that builds, tests, and packages an application. The log files for
    these builds contain a wealth of information, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tests passed</li>
    <li>Tests the team ignored</li>
    <li>Dependencies included</li>
    <li>Packages created</li>
</ul>

<p>You can quickly review these log files if you have a link to the build information from the deployment.</p>

<h3>Library dependencies</h3>

<p>Almost every application deployed today combines custom code with third-party, often open-source, libraries. These
    external libraries provide useful features but can be a source of bugs or security vulnerabilities. Understanding
    all the application's dependencies is essential for security, auditing, and debugging.</p>

<p>Legislation such as the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and the requirements of the NIST “Software Supply Chain Security
    Guidance Under Executive Order (EO) 14028” (<a href="https://oc.to/T3b11u">https://oc.to/T3b11u</a>) may compel you
    to produce Software Bill or
    Materials (SBOMs) to accompany your application, making the management of library dependencies a requirement of your
    CI/CD pipeline.</p>

<h3>Deployment versions</h3>

<p>A release version captures a snapshot of the above information, along with the deployment process, package versions,
    variable values, and scripts. You deploy this release version to each environment.</p>

<p>Displaying which release versions you deployed to each environment provides a high-level view of the state of your deployments. With this information, anyone can see what's deployed where. By drilling into the details of a release, you can see the commit messages, issues, dependencies, and links to the CI builds.</p>

<h2>Pillar 6. Measurable deployments</h2>

<p>The deployment pipeline's primary goal is getting your software into your customers' hands. To understand how well
    your deployment pipeline is performing, you need to measure the metrics that define success for you.</p>

<p>You first need to define useful metrics, then reliably collect them, and surface them in an easy-to-understand format.</p>

<p>Some metrics you can use to track deployments are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Deployment frequency: How frequently do you deploy to production?</li>
    <li>Lead time for changes: How long does it take for a code change to be deployed to production?</li>
    <li>Time to recover deployment: How long does it take to recover from a failed deployment?</li>
    <li>Deployment fail rate: What is the ratio of failed to successful deployments?</li>
    <li>Change fail rate: What is the ratio between hotfix and regular deployments?</li>
    <li>Deployment duration: How long does each deployment take?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pillar 7. Auditable deployments</h2>

<p>If the visible deployments pillar is about surfacing the current state of your environments and the changes made as part of the release, then auditing is about tracking people's involvement in the deployment process over time.</p>

<p>Auditing lets teams see a history of all deployment activity, like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Deployments to environments</li>
    <li>Changes to the deployment process</li>
    <li>Changes to environments</li>
    <li>Who approved a deployment</li>
    <li>The state of an environment at some point in the past</li>
</ul>

<p>For audit events to be helpful, they must be searchable, filterable, and exportable to support reporting and
    analysis.</p>
    
<h2>Pillar 8. Standardized deployments</h2>

<p>Just as repeatable deployments build confidence as you promote a release across environments, standardizing
    deployment processes across different projects allows teams to confidently use proven solutions.</p>
    
<p>Your IDP is an ideal solution for standardizing deployment processes across DevOps teams. Much of what we have
    discussed in this book directly applies to planning, creating, and maintaining standardized deployment
    processes.</p>
<p>As noted in the chapter introduction, CI/CD pipelines are a logical place to embed the automated and scalable
    functionality that platform teams are responsible for delivering. In this case, your IDP is responsible for
    providing the pillar of standardized deployment pipelines, and the pipelines will then embed other appropriate
    pillars.</p>
    
<h2>Pillar 9. Maintainable deployments</h2>

<p>Getting your deployments to the production environment is just the beginning. There are day-to-day operations tasks that keep your applications running and your customers happy. These include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Diagnosing issues</li>
	<li>Collecting logs</li>
	<li>Performing backups</li>
	<li>Restarting services</li>
	<li>Rotating keys</li>
	<li>Testing connections</li>
</ul>

<p>While you could SSH or RDP into a server and start poking around, each change causes your environment configuration to drift, making it harder to implement repeatable deployments. It's also difficult to track changes, verify that they worked, and audit who changed what.</p>

<p>Just like deployments, maintenance tasks should be:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Repeatable</li>
	<li>Verifiable</li>
	<li>Visible</li>
	<li>Measurable</li>
	<li>Auditable</li>
	<li>Standardized</li>
	<li>Coordinated</li>
</ul>

<p>Maintenance tasks represent the business knowledge needed to keep your deployments running and should meet the same standards as your deployment processes.</p>

<h2>Pillar 10. Coordinated deployments</h2>
<p>Deploying a package to an environment is one small part of the deployment process. Often, you need to coordinate
    deployments with other business processes to ensure:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The right people have given their approval</li>
    <li>Interested parties get notified of the success or failure of a deployment</li>
    <li>Deployments proceed in the correct order</li>
    <li>Deployments can only occur during specific times</li>
    <li>High-priority deployments take precedence over low-priority ones</li>
    <li>Deployments get scheduled to take place at a predetermined time</li>
    <li>External events can trigger deployments</li>
    <li>Deployments can trigger external events</li>
</ul>
<p>A deployment process may be a single component in the broader ecosystem of business process management tools. Orchestrating deployments from third-party platforms and reporting results back lets teams manage complex deployments as part of a broader business process.</p>

<h2>Example checklist</h2>
<p>This example checklist provides a table for the platform team to note how to implement the pillars with functional
    requirements.</p>

<p>The values assigned to the pillars are subjective but capture their relative importance.</p>

<p>You then plot these values on a spider (or radar) chart. This visualization identifies both essential and
    deprioritized pillars.</p>

<p>The decision not to implement a feature may be as important as the decision to implement one. The combination of
    the checklist and spider chart surfaces both decision types.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Many IT departments have fallen into the trap of being order-takers, dutifully asking how high when asked to jump. As
    a platform team member, you have a unique opportunity to move beyond order taking. You can lead discussions regarding best
    practices and the future vision of your DevOps teams.</p>

<p>The 10 pillars in this chapter provide a set of non-functional requirements relating to CI/CD. These pillars are
    helpful in discussions with your customers and inspire them as you move towards a more holistic approach to software
    delivery.</p>

<p>The sample checklist reinforces this holistic approach by presenting the pillars as a radar chart, clearly
    identifying which pillars you're considering and which you're not. Capturing all the choices that influence your
    processes helps to keep your focus on your mission as a platform team.</p>

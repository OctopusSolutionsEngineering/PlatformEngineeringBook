<h1><a id="planning">Planning your Internal Developer Platform</a></h1>

<p>It is tempting to think platform engineering has a simple, technical solution. Perhaps a YAML template for your
    Kubernetes cluster, a script for your CI/CD pipeline, or a custom web app providing a dashboard and internal
    registry of templates will solve the immediate requirements. But this technical focus misses the opportunity a
    platform
    team can bring to your organization.</p>

<p>Platform engineering means building a DevEx as a Service platform. A platform team is effectively
    running an internal startup, which means you are not providing a piece of software but a complete service to your
    internal customers.</p>

<p>Running an internal startup can be daunting because platform engineering teams must draw from the work typically done
    by dedicated engineering, support, technical writing, training, developer relations (DevRel), product, and design
    teams. However, addressing a few
    key activities early in the inception of a platform team provides a solid foundation for future growth while
    retaining the agility required to keep pace with high-performing DevOps teams.</p>

<h2>Building your Platform Team</h2>

<p>It can seem like platform teams are saddled with the same do-it-all-yourself mentality as their DevOps customers.
    Indeed, in the early stages, platform engineering teams will attract generalists who enjoy tackling various
    challenges but with a clearly defined mission to avoid taking on an impossibly broad scope of work.</p>

<p>Over time, platform engineering teams evolve to incorporate the kind of specialized roles found in other
    product-focused engineering teams. The "State of DevOps Report Platform Engineering Edition 2023"
    (<a href="https://oc.to/7O5fqO">https://oc.to/7O5fqO</a>) notes that:</p>

<p class="quote">At firms in which a platform team has existed for three or fewer years, 60% of respondents
    identify a need for a
    product manager; at firms in which a platform team has existed for more than three years, this number rises to
    74%.</p>

<p>You can expect a successful platform engineering strategy to work closely with, or incorporate, other specialized
    roles
    such as DevRel, technical support, technical writers, security, and site reliability. That said, though, generalists
    will serve
    your initial platform well by being able to draw on experience from various backgrounds.</p>

<p>The Forbes article “Generalist Vs. Specialist Teams: How To Build A Highly Creative Startup”
    (<a href="https://oc.to/jkdl9C">https://oc.to/jkdl9C</a>) notes that the unpredictable nature of startups does not
    support
    specialization:</p>

<p class="quote">In highly-predictable environments, specialization allows you to solve problems very
    efficiently. In unpredictable
    environments, however, efficiency isn’t as important as creativity. And the environment of innovative startups is
    anything but predictable.</p>

<p>The flip side of bringing people into a platform team is to consider the option of secondments to embed members of
    the platform team back into the wider DevOps ecosystem as a method of sharing knowledge and experience.

    David Jorm, Head Of Security At x15ventures, noted in the podcast "The Journey To Build your Platform Engineering
    Team" (<a href="https://oc.to/a07RuP">https://oc.to/a07RuP</a> that:
</p>

<p class="quote">One of the ways to solve [architectural and cultural issues] is to get secondments from the core
    platform team into that individual engineering team so that I can access some of the thinking behind what was
    done [by the platform team].</p>

<p>The activities listed in this chapter support teams in the initial stages of their platform engineering journey. The
    aim is not to make the platform team experts in product management, marketing, technical writing, and training.
    Instead, these activities reinforce the need to treat platform engineering like a startup rather than a feature to
    be delivered in a sprint and provide a solid foundation for operating an internal product.</p>

<h2>Mission and Focus</h2>

<p>The platform team’s mission and focus are crucial to ensuring that you deliver the highest value solutions to your
    DevOps teams. Some examples of mission statements are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Enforce conformance by provisioning standard deployment pipelines for all microservices.</li>
    <li>Improve security and maintainability by enabling security scanning against all production deployments.</li>
    <li>Manage costs by providing the ability to create standardized cloud resources with self-service workflows.</li>
    <li>Standardize observability by adding monitoring capabilities to all public-facing applications.</li>
    <li>Increase reliability by automating fault detection and rectification for all Kubernetes applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>The mission statement must capture the platform's functional requirements (what the platform will do) and
    non-functional requirements (capabilities that the platform will support, typically "ilities" like observability,
    scalability, and maintainability). It must also positively influence the business concerns listed in the
    "Quantifying the Business Value" section of cost, risk, revenue, and shareholder value.</p>

<p>You can find a comprehensive list of non-functional requirements on Wikipedia (<a href="https://oc.to/UD2mRM">https://oc.to/UD2mRM</a>),
    while the
    chapter “The Ten Pillars of Pragmatic Deployments” documents non-functional requirements tailored to CI/CD
    pipelines.</p>

<p>A simple statement that defines the team's mission will provide context for all their subsequent activities, for
    example, by focusing your user interviews on pain points and aspirations related to the mission while triaging
    support and feature requests based on their alignment with the mission.</p>

<p>The mission statement also guards against the platform engineering team becoming a reactive, general-purpose support
    platform for wider DevOps teams.</p>

<h2>User Interviews</h2>

<p>Talking to your DevOps teams and their management is critical to understanding the opportunities for a platform team
    to improve DevEx. These conversations will quickly highlight the pain points in your company's current processes,
    as well as surfacing many aspirational goals.</p>

<p>Your IDP will be bought by your peers, not sold by their managers, so the people you interview are the same people
    you are trying to sign up for your internal startup. You will gain your customer's trust by taking note of their
    pain and wishes and repeating these observations as you talk about the goals and features of your IDP.</p>

<p>Courtney Kissler, who led large-scale reorganizations and technology transformations at Starbucks, Nike, and Zulily,
    notes in her presentation “How to build internal platforms for the enterprise” (<a href="https://oc.to/V0pDUd">https://oc.to/V0pDUd</a>)
    that:</p>

<p class="quote">Just because you build a platform doesn't mean people are going to consume it.</p>

<p class="quote">It has to solve a need, it has to be compelling, and you need to treat it like a
    product.</p>

<p><i>For those from an engineering background, talking to customers can elicit a feeling of dread. As an engineer, I
    never wanted to talk to customers because every customer I ever interacted with asked me to fix a bug or solve a
    problem. This order-taking was tolerable via asynchronous communication like email, but face-to-face conversation
    felt like an invitation for unbounded personal technical support, which was the last thing I wanted.</i></p>

<p><i>I wasn't necessarily wrong (I've had more than a few "I hope it is OK to email you directly, but I was wondering
    if you could ..." emails after one-on-one conversations). Fortunately, internal user interviews are far more
    informal and enjoyable. They have proven to be a great way to build camaraderie and surfaced many wishes and
    requirements for our IDP.</i></p>

<p>Just as important as listening to your audience is the ability to challenge them with new ideas. Even if you have
    been granted the opportunity to build an IDP, user interviews are still as much about selling the benefits of an IDP
    as it is about gathering requirements (or, in other words, being an order-taker).</p>

<p>The Forbes article “Why Most Salespeople Are Order Takers And Not Sellers” (<a href="https://oc.to/VmnpgR">https://oc.to/VmnpgR</a>)
    notes that:</p>

<p class="quote">Selling is about change, and it's salespeople's job to influence that change. Salespeople
    who can't influence change are simply order-takers.</p>

<p>Gregor Hohpe similarly notes in his book “The Software Architect Elevator” that modern IT departments have moved
    beyond order taking:</p>

<p class="quote">Positioning IT architecture on par with business architecture highlights, though, that the
    days when IT was a simple order-taker that provides a commodity resource at the lowest possible cost are (luckily)
    over. In the digital age, IT is a competitive differentiator and opportunity driver, not a commodity like
    electricity.</p>

<p>You are uniquely positioned as a platform team member to understand the different viewpoints held by your DevOps
    teams, to share those insights with a broader audience, and sell a vision for how an DEaaS can influence positive
    change in an organization. Remember, you are running a startup, not building a better conveyor belt.</p>

<p>For those platform engineering teams tasked with improving their CI/CD pipelines, the chapter "The Ten Pillars of
    Pragmatic Deployments" lists typical deployment pipeline non-functional requirements. These provide valuable
    prompts to surface desirable qualities as you talk with your customers.</p>

<h2>Documentation and Training</h2>

<p>Your IDP is a tool that tool builders use. It integrates many other tools and platforms. It needs to be flexible,
    configurable, and customizable. In short, it is a bespoke product encapsulating and supporting the specific
    requirements of your internal teams and organization.</p>

<p>Your customers don't have the luxury of Googling how to use this internal tool and there are no posts on Stack
    Overflow to point them in the right direction. The lack of external community support means your platform requires
    robust documentation and training for your internal customers to get the most out of it.</p>

<p>The success of your IDP can be measured by its ability to embed best practices more broadly than would be possible if
    individuals were to implement them within each team or project. This scale is only possible if DevOps teams can
    understand and implement the solution without requiring a personal demonstration every time. Documentation and
    training are two proven solutions for upskilling customers at a time and pace that suits them.</p>

<p><i>"Any product that needs a manual to work is broken." It's a catchy quote from Elon Musk, and yet the first time I
    caught a Tesla Model 3, my Uber driver had to open the door for me because I didn't know how the handles worked.
    Thankfully, and ironically, Tesla's online owner's manual has excellent documentation on how to open the doors. I'll
    know better next time.</i></p>

<h2>Support</h2>

<p>A considerable aspect of the ongoing operation of your IDP is the support you offer your
    internal customers. While it is tempting to think you'll have a captive audience with a mandate to use your
    platform, in reality, you are competing with how DevOps teams used to do things. If your IDP does not work as
    expected (which is inevitable at some point, given the scope of what platform engineering encompasses), you must
    have a responsive support channel. Otherwise, your customers will revert to their existing processes.</p>

<p>Your documentation and training efforts can significantly complement your support processes. Ideally, supporting your
    customers means pointing them to the documentation or training that answers their questions, addressing a bug, or
    accepting a feature request.</p>

<p>A responsive support layer is critical to prevent your solution from being the blocker a platform team should remove.
    Nothing is more detrimental to DevEx than the broken flow caused by a blocking issue and an unresponsive support
    team.</p>

<p>Note that being responsive is not the same as solving every problem. It is an anti-pattern to move all the pain to
    the platform team by expecting them to provide site reliability services, general advice, or function as a help
    desk.</p>

<p>Platform teams must balance many concerns while interacting with their customers:</p>

<ol>
    <li>To provide internal customers with opinionated solutions.</li>
    <li>To support these solutions to prevent customers from being blocked.</li>
    <li>To encourage customers to implement their own customizations and incorporate those improvements into your IDP.
    </li>
    <li>To manage the potential expectation that the platform team will immediately support anyone with any issue.</li>
</ol>

<p>The best way to maintain this balance is to clearly define levels of responsibility. This ensures the platform team
    and their customers have a clear understanding of who is responsible for maintaining the artifacts generated by an
    IDP. The chapter "Platform Engineering Responsibilities" discusses different responsibility models.</p>

<h2>Issue Tracking and Feature Requests</h2>

<p>The ability to track the status of issues discovered in your IDP and to track any progress with feature requests
    provides your customers confidence that bugs are being fixed and requests are taken seriously.</p>

<p>Your customers will be technical people familiar with issue-tracking platforms like Jira, GitHub, Bugzilla, etc. You
    will likely have an issue tracker already in use by your DevOps teams, and reusing it for your IDP is a natural
    choice.</p>

<p><i>Be confident enough to admit you must wait to implement new features. While working in product teams, I was
    overwhelmed with requests for new features and improvements and felt that confessing that we wouldn't consider even
    great ideas for at least 6 to 12 months was admitting defeat. Often, I just ignored these requests, but that was a
    mistake. Having been on the other side of that conversation, I'd prefer an honest answer to no answer.</i></p>

<h2>Marketing</h2>

<p>Building an IDP is a long-term commitment, and as you fix bugs, add features, or respond to changing requirements,
    you must be able to publish new and improved solutions to your internal customers.</p>

<p>Typically, your IDP will either push changes out to your customers or allow them to pull the changes as they are made
    available. If you opt for a pull-based approach, you'll need a method for notifying your customers of new
    features.</p>

<p>However, as impressive as your IDP may be, you will only reach the point of needing such a solution when your
    customers already have a dozen other platforms they need to use every day. One of the challenges of running a
    startup is respecting your customers' attention and not abusing that relationship with noise.</p>

<p>Most DevOps teams have an internal chat solution, which can be a low-friction method of announcing features or
    changes. Lunch-and-learn sessions are another excellent way to reach your internal customers. Also, consider
    recording a demonstration of the new features and sharing it as a monthly webinar.</p>

<p><i>One of the tips I learned when I moved to a sales team was the value of existing, general-purpose meetings
    preallocated in a team’s calendar. Never underestimate how hard it is to find a time for everyone to meet. Being
    able to present at a lunch-and-learn is an incredible opportunity for your marketing efforts.</i></p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>Feedback from your customers is crucial to understanding whether you are meeting their expectations.</p>

<p>There are many examples of embedding feedback into processes, including:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Net Promoter Score (NPS)</li>
    <li>Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)</li>
    <li>Questionnaires</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember, though, that high-quality feedback scores require an appropriate sample size. Unless many internal
    customers use your IDP, you may not be able to passively source feedback from enough people to generate meaningful
    scores.</p>

<p>In the paper “Belief in the Law of Small Numbers”, Kahneman and Tversky define the Law of Small Numbers as the
    mistaken belief that a small sample accurately reflects the probabilities of a population. With small sample sizes,
    those few customers who felt like providing feedback may unduly influence how well you believe all customers
    received your IDP.</p>

<p>The effort spent encouraging your internal customers to supply asynchronous feedback may be better spent scheduling
    user
    interviews after releasing features or on a regular schedule. Compared to most product teams, you have the advantage
    of working side by side with your customers, and it would be a missed opportunity not to take advantage of this.</p>

<p>However, there is still value in offering a real-time feedback mechanism, if only to provide an outlet for frustrated
    customers to signal their displeasure. Just as most product teams would prefer to receive such feedback directly
    rather than second hand via channels like social media, platform teams benefit from the opportunity to resolve these
    issues directly rather than hearing from the CTO that their IDP is not meeting expectations.</p>

<p><i>A common pattern I have noticed in many mobile apps is a two-step feedback process. The first question is designed
    to gauge whether the customer would provide a positive or negative rating. Those that indicated they would provide a
    negative rating are redirected to an internal feedback channel, while those providing positive feedback are
    forwarded to the public app store.</i></p>

<p>So while passive feedback methods like NPS and CSAT scores may not provide reliable metrics with small sample
    sizes, it is still worth collecting this data. Conversations with customers are where you will find the actual
    value. But offering a way to submit negative feedback provides platform teams the opportunity to quickly resolve, or
    at least understand, points of friction. Meanwhile, any positive feedback is marketing gold, regardless of the
    statistical significance.</p>

<h2>Example Checklist</h2>

<p>The following checklist is an example that documents how you might address the activities noted in this chapter. As
    you can see, this example checklist is not complicated, but it does commit the platform team to:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Defining the mission statement</li>
    <li>Selecting individuals for user interviews</li>
    <li>Writing introductory documentation</li>
    <li>Creating onboarding training</li>
    <li>Selecting support and notifications platforms</li>
    <li>Committing to regular internal announcements to demonstrate new features</li>
    <li>Planning follow-up user interviews at regular intervals to gain feedback</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This chapter reinforced the importance of treating your platform engineering initiative as an internal startup within
    your company. You are not building a feature but instead creating an end-to-end solution with all the business
    processes customers would expect from any business-critical application they adopted for their day-to-day
    operations.</p>

<p>Platform engineering is not a trivial undertaking, but for those lucky enough to be involved, it is an exciting
    opportunity to run a business in a business.</p>

<p>The activities listed in this chapter precede any discussion about implementing an IDP. Prioritizing these activities
    is quite deliberate and highlights the importance of planning for success before implementing the solution. The
    example checklist provides an easy way to ensure these requirements are tangible and not afterthoughts.</p>
